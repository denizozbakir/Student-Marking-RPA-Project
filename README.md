# Student-Marking-RPA-Project


The main goal of the “Student Marking RPA Project” is to take the marking process of students’ Excel files from Excel VBA to Python. The students must deliver a Macro-Enabled Workbook file to be graded before, with this project Workbook files will be graded too. The project will be compatible with two operating systems mainly: Windows, and MacOS. 

Having looked at the old scenario, the marking process was done with Excel VBA and had some important issues. Python’s better debugging and error handling will reduce the development time and make the source code much more maintainable compared to the Excel VBA. On the other hand, Python is open-source and free, which results in a larger community of developers who can offer support, share knowledge, and contribute to the development of libraries.
